I love fast, minimal websites.

Born in Canada, but raised in the United States, I have visited, worked, or lived in over 60 countries on five continents.

Saving the planet is important to me. That’s why you’ll find me striving to write clean code to reduce energy consumption. I’m also a bulwark against ocean plastic pollution.
